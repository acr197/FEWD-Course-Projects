				<strong>Andrew Ryan</strong> is a digital marketing analyst based in New York City. He currently works at DigitasLBi as a Media Tech Analyst for Under Armour and Delta Airlines, and formerly for Pitney Bowes, FIS, NYSE, and Izze Drinks. <br> <br>
				Over the past decade, Andrew has taken on a variety of professional roles.

				In an effort to show his dedication and strive in his field, Andrew has completed the Google Adwords and Google Analytics Certification, completed a course on Front End Web Development, and is continuously taking courses and certifications - including Excel and analytics this year. This website was also completely designed and coded by him from scratch.<br> <br>
				When Andrew is not working, you will probably find Andrew writing and recording music in his home-studio, traveling to a new part of the world, cooking an excesive amount of food for his next dinner, or trying something new on the menu over the weekend. <br> <br>
